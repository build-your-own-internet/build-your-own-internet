# Name Resolution

## Goal

Stop cheating (remove `extra_hosts` from docker-compose) and implement a name resolution like service on each machine and see name-resolution work.

## Where we are currently

We started looking at using avahi, added it to the chapter 002 docker file as an apt-get

started the daemon with `avahi-daemon --debug` and got an error:

```bash
dbus_bus_get_private(): Failed to connect to socket /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket: No such file or directory
```

looked in `/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf` and set `enable-dbus=no`

everything worked for a local setup, i.e. between host-c and host-f

able to ping with a `local` label appended to the hostname on the same network:

```bash
root@host-c:/# ping host-f.local
PING host-f.local (6.0.0.106) 56(84) bytes of data.

```

we need to get the routers in on the joke. this will require teaching the routers how to handle multicast requests

Next Steps

- automatically set `enable-dbus=no` for all configs (start-up.sh)
- look into what we need to do to configure the routers (peba recommends pim-dense gets installed on all the routers)
