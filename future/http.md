# HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

## Goal

What's an internet without some actual content on it? Let's implement HTTP so our client has some meaningful objects to request from the server!

HTTP is the protocol that all of our modern applications are built on. It identifies ways of retrieving and modifying data. HTTP scales from a simple page on one server to a globally distributed worldwide cached application.

By the time we're through, let's answer:

- Can we generate a simple HTTP application on the server?
- Can we make that application talk to a DB on another server?
- Can we expand the application to be a server side rendered javascript application, e.g. remix or next?

NOTE: setting up a basic HTTP system enables us to meaningfully test if some of our other systems (e.g. caching) work. The goal here is to enable more learning about the internet, not necessarily practicing software development.

## Implementation Questions

What software are you gonna install?
How will you know if it works?
How will you troubleshoot problems?
Links or existing documentation that could be helpful?
Can you draw what your internet will look like by the end of your implementation?
