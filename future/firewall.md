# Firewall

## Goal

We have an internet! But... do we trust all of the servers on that internet? Let's setup some firewalls to block bad actors!

A firewall is a network security tool that ensures that traffic can only be routed between authorized network entities.

By the time we're through, let's answer:

- Can we block traffic from a known bad IP address/prefix?
- Can we protect a client network by blocking all incoming requests (not responses)?
- How do we setup a secure web service?
  - Can we limit traffic to a DB to only a single server?
  - How do we setup and enforce different zones of trust?

PRO TIP! Complete the HTTP and TCP chapters first.

## Implementation Questions

What software are you gonna install?
How will you know if it works?
How will you troubleshoot problems?
Links or existing documentation that could be helpful?
Can you draw what your internet will look like by the end of your implementation?
