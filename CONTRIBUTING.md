## how to develop a new chapter

* start in the future folder
* promote to chapters when checklist complete

## Chapter Ready: Definition of Done

Chapter has each of the following:

* a well defined goal
* content that meets that goal
* activities for readers to participate/explore in achieving that goal
* exercises at the end to explore further/test understanding

## Checklist: Move Chapter from Future => Chapters

* reread the whole chapter checking for:
  * flow
  * comprehension
  * definitions
  * links to glossary/websites
* check that all commands work as described
* all TODOs within the chapter are resolved and removed (unless there is a much grander reason to keep them)
